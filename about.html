		  <!-- Introduction
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="introduction" class="page-header">About Ajax Live Search</h1>

  <p> By default, WordPress search sorts search results by date instead of relevance. It also uses a week algorithym, meaning that users are more likely to view useless results at the top of the page while the relevant results are not even on page one. That's where ajax live search comes in.</p>
  <p> Apart from adding relevance based search, it comes with a couple of other functionality such as live searching, ajax searching, autocompletes and query logging. You can check the <a href="../features.html">features page</a> for a full list of features.</p>
  <p> You can contribute to aLs development by <a href="https://github.com/picocodes/aLs/issues/new">opening an issue</a> or submitting a pull request.</p>

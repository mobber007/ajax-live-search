		  <!-- Features
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="relevance" class="page-header">Relevance based search</h2>
  <p> Ajax Live Search uses a combination of tf-idf and a couple of other factors such as whether a phrase appears in the title or not to determine whether a given content is relevant to a search term or not. Version 2 (expected to come out before the year ends) is stated to leverage that to the inbuilt fulltext engine of MySQL which does the same thing.</p>
  <p> Stopwords and words that appear in more than 50% of the documents will not have any effect on the ranking.</p>
  <p> We also use the porter stemmer to stem given words to their root form; so that when someone searches for a term like editing they get results containing the terms editor, edit and editable. Very few of the current plugins does that. None that I know of.</p></p>
  <p> Here is a sample example of how we calculate this;</p>
  <pre>$tf = number_of_appearances_in($content) *weight;
/*
 weight is set to 0 for stopwords and popular words
 Hence total tf-idf becomes zero therefore not impacting ranking
*/
$idf = log(inverse((number_of_documents_containing($phrase) / total_number_of_documents()));
	
$tf-idf = tf * df;
  </pre>
  <p> Now whenever someone searches for a given phrase, we just hit the database and ask MySQL to order the results by tf-idf in descending order. You will notice that results will be mostly relevant to the search query.</p>
  <p> The pro version takes this a step further by making use of markov chains and ngrams to include relevant queries in the search results. For example, when you mispell your query, it will automatically include the results for the correctly spelled query, hence a better search experience.</p>
  </div>
		  <!-- Live search
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="live-search" class="page-header">Ajax and Live search</h2>
  <p> When you enable live search; aLs will load results whenever a user adds or removes a word from the main search box.</p>
  <p> Results are therefore loaded without even submitting the form. We chose to use word-based loading instead of character based loading so as to reduce server load. This is because addition of a single character is highly unlikely to affect the number of matching articles.</p>
  <p> Ajax search uses the same principle except that results are loaded whenever the form is submitted instead.</p>
  <p> The two features make use of ajax to load results without reloading the page, hence very good for user experience. This plus the fact that results are mostly loaded from the cache means that you should enable it even on very slow servers.</p>
  </div>
  
		  <!-- Autocompletes
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="auto-completes" class="page-header">Autocompletes</h2>
  <p> When you enable this feature; we will give the user a couple of query suggestions depending on what he/she is typing. It's pretty similar to what Google and other search engines do when you start typing in there search forms.</p>
  <p> What makes aLs stand out from the rest is that you have a couple of choices on what engine should provide the suggestions. When you chose to use the local database; you will be able to dictate whether to use the posts table or the previous searches table to show suggestions.</p>
  <p> Pro users can also chose between Google or YouTube. This is good when trying to minimise server load since the suggestions are fetched from Google instead.</p>

  </div>

 		  <!-- Statistics
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="statistics" class="page-header">Query logging and Statistics</h2> 
  <img src="../assets/img/preview-stats.png" alt="stats" class="img-responsive"></img>

	<p> Whenever a user searches, we save the query to your WordPress database so that you can take a look at them later and user them to generate statistics.</p>
	<p> We even save you time by generating some of the statistics ourselves(both in table form and graphical form). You can take a look at them from the statistics tab.</p>
	<p> In order to generate you own statistics, click on the button that asks you to save them in csv form then download the statistics using the link generated. You can then open them using your own spreasheet app and apply your own formulae on it or generate your own graphs using it.</p>
	<p> You can also use it to get new content ideas. Just navigate to the table listing popular searches that contain zero results and then use them as keyword ideas.</p>
</div>  

 		  <!-- Caching
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="caching" class="page-header">Query caching</h2> 
  <p> This is only available in the pro version.</p>
<img src="../assets/img/preview2.png" alt="caching" class="img-responsive"></img>
  <p> Whenever a user searches for a given term, we check to see if it's results exist in our cache. If they do, we fetch them. Otherwise, we query the database for results, save them in the cache and display that instead.</p>
	<p> It works together with other caching systems since it only affects the results section of the search results page. However, unlike other systems; the cache is only updated whenever a new post is added to the index. This is because the order of search results only change whenever a post is added to the database.</p>
	<p> We again use stemming and markov models so that whenever a user searches for a phrase like 'writing an article', 'writing articles' or 'write an article'; we point them to the same cache instead of creating 3 different caches.</p>
	<p> The only exception to this is when a user uses search modifiers in their search queries.</p>
</div>

 		  <!-- sponsored
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="sponsored" class="page-header">Sponsored Results</h2> 
  <p> For affiliate marketers, you can configure aLs to do the marketing for you. Just like Google displays sponsored results at the top of their search results pages, you can also display links to your affiliate products on top of yours. You have the choice of deciding how many results we display. </p>
  <p> This increases chances of conversions since the links are highly targeted to the user's intend.</p>
  <p> For example, when someone searches for a phrase like 'summer clothing advice', we query the database for sponsored results that contain the phrase 'summer clothing' (since 'advice' is a stopword).</p>
  <p> If we get a hit, we display it on the search results page; just like normal results are displayed, except it has a different background and we include the word sponsored result. i.e; we show a link (containing the title you provided) to the affiliate website and then add a description below it.</p>

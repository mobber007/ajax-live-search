<h3> Changing how search results are ranked.</h3>

<p> You can assign weights to different post types and fields such as post titles and comments.</p>

<p> For example, you can assign more weight to the products post type to boost the ranking of products in the search results page.</p>

<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="customising" class="page-header">Customising</h2>

	<p> Ajax Live Search comes in a ready to use mode. It is compatible with most themes since it uses the active theme's styles to maintain the theme's look.</p>

	<p> However, it comes with it's own search template and also adds it's own styles to the search forms on your website. If your theme does not follow the WordPress theme development guidlines, this might break things a little (in terms of styling).</p>

	<p> You should therefore visit the homepage and try to search and see how the suggestions appear. You can also click on one suggestion or click on submit and take a look at how the search page appears.</p>

	<p> If you don't like how it feels, or would just like to give it a personal touch, then visit the plugin editor in your dashboard and click on ajax live search; then click on style.css to edit it.</p>

	<p> after customising the frontend, head over to the settings tab to customise what appears in your front page; by enabling and disabling certain features.</p>

<h3 id="ft-enable">Enabling additional features</h3>
	<p> The settings page has 3 tabs; general, searching and result pages.</p>
		<div class="row">
		<h4 id="general">General settings tab</h4>

			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-6">

				<p>Currently, the only thing that you can change in the general settings tab is toggling caching on and off.</P>

				<p>You can also use this page to index more posts by clicking on the index more tab.</p>

			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p> This tab is used to change how the plugin indexes and searches through posts and pages.</p>

				<p> To learn more about these features; please visit the <a href="../features">features page</a> and take a look at how they work.</p>

		<h4 id="searching">Adding/Viewing sponsored results.</h4>	
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p> Ajax search let's you add sponsored results so that they can be displayed on top of search results when a user submits a relevant query.</p>

				<p> In your dashboard, point your cursor to ajax live search and then click on sponsored results. </p>

<p>You will see a list of all the sponsored results that you have added. Click on add new to create a new sponsored result. You will be able to fill a form with the title, description, tags and link of your sponsored result.</p>

<p> Your sponsored result will be shown at the top of the search results whenever it matches a search term. </p>

				<p> You can toggle this on/off in the settings tab. You will also have a chance to specify the number of sponsored results to show in a search query.</p>

<!-- numbers
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="statistics" class="page-header">Viewing Search Statistics</h2>

  <p> Ajax Live Search saves search queries so that you can analyse them later. You have the option of viewing the statistics as a table or in form of graphs. These statistics are especially good when searching for new content ideas.</p>

  <p> If you have the pro version, you can also import the statistics as a csv file and analyse them offline in your favourite spreadsheet.</p>

  <p> If no searches have been made and you need to test it out, just click on the generate dummy data button and the plugin will create some dummy content for you to play with.</p>

  <p> To view these statistics; in your dashboard, click on the statistics tab of the ajax Live search menu. Here, you can toggle between graphs and tables and also generate dummy data or download it as a csv document.</p>

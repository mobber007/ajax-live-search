<h3> Below is the algorithym that we use to calculate the relevance of a result.</h3>
<p> We take the query and then modify it by stripping words that belong to our list of stopwords and those that appear in more than 50% of the documents. This is because these types of words don't actually  add any value to the results.</p>
<p> We then fetch results using our new query and apply the supplied modifiers. If no posts are found; we let WordPress (or your favourite plugin such as relevanssi) do the search and use it's results. This is because they do fuzzy searching by using the 'LIKE' clause hence producing way more result.</p>
<p> For example; a search for "let's all play" won't produce any results in aLs while the default search will probaly return all published posts in the database.</p>
<p> This is because it will search for posts containing either let's, all or play.</p>
<p> In case we fetch any results; we use the following factors to calculate the relevance of each result.</p>
<ul>
<li> IF the query appears in the title, get the tf-idf of the query in respect to the title the multiply that by the weight supplied.</li>
<li> IF the query appears in the main content, get the tf-idf of the query in respect to the content the multiply that by the weight supplied.</li>
<li> Fetch the weight for each post type the apply it to the found results.</li>
<li> Use the current time() to calculate the log of the linear regression from the time the post was published.</li>
<li> Calculate the log of the linear regression in respect to the comments count + 1. The +1 is so as to avoid the undefined value of log(0) for posts containing no comments; it also prevents the assignement of 0 to posts with 1 comment since log(1) us 0.</li>
<li> Calculate the linear regression of the quality score of the post. To calculate quality; we apply several factors such as click through rate in the search results, word count and our own pagerank algorithym.</li>
</ul>
<p> To speed up the searching, we calculate some of the data during indexing. The result is a system that works at the same speed as WordPress' inbuilt system (and faster than most of the available options).</p>
<p> If you enable query caching; the time taken to complete a search is almost 2 times less.</p>
<p> NOTE: Some of these features are only available in the premium version.</p>

<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="customising" class="page-header">Customising</h2>

	<p> aLs comes in a ready to use mode. It is compatible with most themes since it uses the active theme's styles to maintain the theme's look.</p>
	<p> However, it comes with it's own search template and also adds it's own styles to the search forms on your website. If your theme does not follow the WordPress theme development guidlines, this might break things a little (in terms of styling).</p>
	<p> You should therefore visit the homepage and try to search and see how the suggestions appear. You can also click on one suggestion or click on submit and take a look at how the search page appears.</p>
	<p> If you don't like how it feels, or would just like to give it a personal touch, the visit the plugin editor in your dashboard and click on ajax live search; then click on style.css to edit it.</p>
	<p> after customising the frontend, head over to the settings tab to customise what appears in your front page; by enabling and disabling certain features.</p>
<h3 id="ft-enable">Enabling additional features</h3>
	<p> The settings page has 3 tabs; general, searching and result pages.</p>

		<h4 id="searching">Adding/Viewing sponsored results.</h4>	
			<div>
				<p> Ajax search live let's you add sponsored results so that they can be displayed on top of search results when a user submits a relevant query.</P>
				<p> In your dashboard, point your cursor to ajax live search and then click on sponsored results. You will see a list of all the sponsored results that you have added. Click on add new to create a new sponsored result. You willl be able to fill a form with the title, description, tags and link of your sponsored result. After saving, your sponsored result will be shown at the top of the search results when someone searches for a relevant query.</p>
				<p> You can toggle this on/off in the settings tab. You will also have a chance to specify the number of sponsored results to show in a search query.</p>

<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h2 id="statistics" class="page-header">Viewing Statistics</h2>
  <p> aLs logs search queries so that you can analyse them later. You have the option of viewing the statistics as table or in form of graphs. These statistics are especially good when searching for new content ideas.</p>
  <p> You can also import the statistics as csv and analyse them offline in your favourite spreadsheet.</p>
  <p> If no searches have been made and you need to test it out, just click on the generate dummy data button and aLs will create some dummy content for you to play with.</p>
  <p> To view these statistics; in your dashboard, click on the statistics tab of the ajax Live search menu. Here, you can toggle between graphs and tables and also generate dummy data or view it as a pdf document.</p>

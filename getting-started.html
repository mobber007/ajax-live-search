                    <p>Before you can start searching, Ajax Live Search will first need to index your posts. </p>
					<p>During this process, your site may start slowing down but after a few minutes everything should be indexed and back to normal.</p>
					<p>However; there are a couple of things you can do to speed up this process.</p>
					<p>1. Start by increasing your memory limit and maximum excecution time to x3 the current amount.</p>
					<p>2. Then, on the Ajax Live Search settings page, click on the indexing tab and then increase the value of batches to a higher number (Preferably 1/5 of the total number of your posts).</p>
					<p>3. Continue browsing your site, and after everything is indexed, reset everything back to normal.</p>

                    <p>Before ajax and live search features take effect on your site; you may have to make some changes to your search template. In your admin dashboard, locate the appearance menu link and select editor.</p>
					<p>Select your active theme and locate the file that renders search results. This is usually named search.php .</p>
					<p>Click to edit, then add the following code immeadiately before the line that says <code>if ( have_posts() ) :</code>.</p>
					<pre> if ( function_exists('als_ajax_init') ) {
			
	als_ajax_init();
			
}
					</pre>
					
					<p> Next; scroll down the page until you enter the while loop, then copy the file name that appears between <code>get_template_part()</code></p>
					<p> In the official twentysixteen theme, this file is usually named <code>template-parts/content-search</code></p>
					<p> Finally, open the ajax live search settings page and click on the searching tab. Enable ajax/live search then scroll down to the template file field and insert the name that you copied in the above step.</p>

                    <p>1. Make sure that you have enabled caching and that the maximum cache time is set to a number relative to your posting frequency.</p>
					<p>2. If you enable autocompletes; select Google as the engine (Or YouTube if you have a media/news site) so as to decrease server load. If you must use the local engine; then make sure to enable caching.</p>
					<p>3. Edit the autocomplete and snippet look to match your site appearance.</p>
					<p>4. Giving your titles and permalinks more weight will ensure that the most relevant results appear at the top.</p>
					<p>5. Query correction will only work if there is a good amount of previous searches.</p>
					<p>6. To prevent most of the problems; make sure that you have at least 10 posts published.</p>
